"Inertial drag and lift forces for coarse grains on rough alluvial beds" in Earth Surface Dynamics by Maniatis et al. 2020

There are two data sets:
The frist is for the laboratory experiments performed in the flume facilities of the University of Glasgow (2013-2014) for both the spherical and the ellipsoid of the sensors.

The second corresponds to the field experiments pefromed in River Erlenbach (May 2018) and correspond to the ellipsoid only.
